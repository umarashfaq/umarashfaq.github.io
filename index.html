				<h2>Solve tech problems faster</h2>
				<p>
					Human brains are optimized for thinking in images. That is
					why we imagine the logic in our minds when we are solving a
					problem. But imagination struggles when the logic is more
					complex, and it fades when there are interruptions.

				<h2>Collaborate better with others</h2>
				<p>
					Whether youâ€™re working with a team or doing a remote
					interview, explaining your solution to the other party
					becomes increasingly difficult as the logic grows more
					complex. With Clarity, you can be sure that the other party
					is perceiving your solution in exactly the way you want it
					to be perceived.

				<h2>Focus on problem, not syntax</h2>
				<p>
					With most other diagramming tools, you are either struggling
					to point and draw boxes and connectors, or wrangling with
					syntax. Clarity aims to remove the syntactical problems out
					of the way, so you can focus on your logic.
				</p>

				<h2>Version control your diagrams</h2>
				<p>
					Clarity is a lightweight desktop application, which means
					you can manage your diagram files yourself. Diagram files
					are essentially text files which just contain your input
					text. Which means, you can version control and share your
					files as you like.

				<h2>Enjoy free of cost</h2>
				<p>
					Since Clarity is a desktop application, there are not any
					hosting bills that need to be covered. Hence it allows us to
					have you enjoy the application for free. There are no hidden
					charges either.
