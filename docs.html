			Clarity is dead simple to use, and most likely you would not need to
			refer docs once you get a hang of it. Here are some of the key
			concepts:

		<h2>Key Concepts</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>Lines as sequence of boxes</h3>
				<p>
					Each line of text, as long as it has text, is rendered as a
					box. Multiple lines are rendered as sequence of boxes,
					connected by arrows. At this point, the diagram flows from
					top to bottom.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Hashtags for special behavior</h3>
				<p>
					Hashtags (a.k.a. directives) can be dropped on any line for
					special behavior. For example, if you want to make round
					corners out of an entry box, simply drop #enter directive
					anywhere on the line. It does not matter where a directive
					is placed in a line. See "Directives" section below for list
					of available directives.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Indentation for groups</h3>
				<p>
					Indentation is typically used to group a number of
					statements together. For example, see the usage of #group
					and #if directives.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Comments</h3>
				<p>
					Clarity supports C style comments with double forward
					slashes. Anything in comments is ignored.
				</p>
			</li>
