<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
	Tech workers run into complex problems quite often, and mostly rely on a pen
	and paper to sketch a solution. While using pen and paper is intuitive (zero
	learning curve), it becomes challenging in the following events:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A sketch needs to grow beyond the bounds of the paper</li>
	<li>User has to delete some parts of a sketch</li>
	<li>User has to share a sketch with others for review</li>
	<li>User has to save a sketch so it can be referred later</li>
	<li>User has to search for an old sketch</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Digital alternatives are so bad that most of the users continue to rely on
	pen and paper (despite limitations of the medium). Most digital alternatives
	(e.g. LucidCharts, Draw.io) give users low level graphical components that
	they can use to construct their sketches. But most of the time, users end up
	finding themselves drawing boxes and connectors instead of solving the
	problem they originally set out to solve.
</p>

<p>
	There are some systems available that allow users to construct sketches
	using text (e.g. DOT), but those systems have heavy syntax requirements.
	Users may find themselves spending more brain power in specifying correct
	graph syntax, rather than solving their original problem.
</p>

<p>
	Clarity is an attempt to evolve such text to drawing systems. Here is the
	fundamental hypothesis on top of which Clarity is developed:
</p>

<p>
	If users are presented with a digital tool that is more intuitive than other
	digital alternatives, and allows them to focus on the problem at hand
	without getting entangled into the system semantics, they will favor using
	it over pen and paper. The system can, in turn, increase their productivity
	since visually laying out a problem makes it easier for a human brain to
	grasp it, and collaborate on it.
